Unum is an insurance company that specializes in providing insurance products with a focus on disability insurance 

I would love to work for UNUM considering my qualities as a fast-paced learner and the culture I would love to express and share among people that i'm surrounded by.  With the past team projects I've worked on in school for software development as a scrum master, ui/ux designer and a coder I enjoy being in a environment where I get to cooperate with my teammates.  This IT intern position would allow me to apply my skills as being a strategic and tactical thinker for projects i'll be working on which would ultimately help me develop my growth as an individual and learn new technologies and concepts by the day. 

questions: 
What technologies and tools will i be using during my internship?
what will be my primary responsibilities as an it intern? 
are you able to provide more assignments or projects 
could you provide more information regarding community service activities?
