Unum is an insurance company that specializes in providing insurance products with a focus on disability insurance 

I would love to work for UNUM considering my qualities as a fast-paced learner and the culture I would love to express and share among people that i'm surrounded by.  With the past team projects I've worked on in school for software development as a scrum master, ui/ux designer and a coder I enjoy being in a environment where I get to cooperate with my teammates.  This IT intern position would allow me to apply my skills as being a strategic and tactical thinker for projects i'll be working on which would ultimately help me develop my growth as an individual and learn new technologies and concepts by the day.

Questions


I grew up in columbia, south carolina my entire life and university of south carolina was my first choice for college because I chose to live with my parents due to financial reasons and wanting to to take care of my family as they are getting old. I value family as important as education so I would want to commute from home so I can get to see them more often. The reason why i chose computer science as my major is pretty cool i would like to think. I've been freelancing as a video editor in high school and I would work with adobe products producing videos for different clients. Part of the production process included utilizing javascript expressions to produce effects such as counting from 1 to 1000 in a matter of miliseconds. I thought that was really cool to me and I ended up taking a computer science class where I got to learn more about Java and used scratch to build projects. I realized that I enjoyed solving problems through coding and building applications where I can express my creativity.

**Please walk us through any campus involvement or leadership opportunities you have been involved with. What has been your favorite activity and why?**

For campus involvement i am apart of the vietnamese student organization along with the phillipino student organization and taiwanese student roganization where I get to meet other people on a day to day basis and learn about the culture of other people. I also participate in service saturdays that is hosted by USC where I get to volunteer for a few hours at a station of my choosing. It happens only once a month so I try to free my saturdays for this opportunity.  One of the most lasting impacts I've had from a leadership opportunity was being the director of visual arts for a business that me and a couple others started which we specialized in video production and social media management for our clients. We secured a client with a luxury piano shop and I was responsible for communicating with the client for their needs and hiring cinematographers that could come into the store to shoot footage. I really enjoyed the process of managing a team and discussing with the clients and we were able to produce products that exceeded our clients standards. I would say that this would be my favorite activity


**Please explain any work or internship experiences and how you feel these have prepared you for an internship at Unum. What excites you most about participating in Unum's intern program if selected for the opportunity?**


Going back to what i said about being the director of visual arts for a business, it has helped me think both tactically and strategically when it came to achieving our clients needs and goals and ultimately setting the business forward. Utilizing our clients feedback to hone in a higher quality product has helped improve my relationships with the people on my team and with our client too. These skills would carry over being an IT intern at unum where I get to work and collaborate with other team members. What excites me most is the different technologies I would get to work with and grow as an indivdual from learning. Looking at the past intern projects, one of them included prototyping and working with a scrum team to perpare documentation and implement multiple products. As someone who was responsible for being the UI/UX designer and scrum master for a group project in a software engineering class, I would love to establish my skills in this position so that I get to improve as a learner. 

**Do you have any post-graduation goals?**
	On top of constantly learning new technologies, A major goal of mine is that Id like to be with a company where i feel a sense of security and loyalty and being passionate about what im doing. I like the feeling of making a positive contribution for the company I work for. 
One of the major goals of mine after I graduate is to 



**When was a time you faced a challenge and overcame a setback? What happened in that situation? What did you learn from the experience?**

I was responsible for coding the 4 main user stories of our application as that was a requirement for our project along with being the scrum master and ensuring that deadlines were being met. I had another team member that was responsible for creating the backbone of our application by creating the data and singleton classes that contained information such as
