Balance Factor for each node = height of left subtree - height of right subtree

- If the inserted node is in the right subtree of the right subtree of A, rotate the nodes left

- If the inserted node is in the left subtree of the left subtree of A, rotate the nodes right

- If the inserted node is in the right subtree of the left subtree of A, rotate the subtree to the left then rotate the full tree to the right

- If the inserted node is in the left subtree of the right subtree of A, rotate the subtree to the right then rotate the full tree to the left. 

Example:

Insert Node E, gives I a balance factor of 2. The node is inserted in the right subtree of B of left subtree of I.
