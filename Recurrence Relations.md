n-k = number  where number is the lower bound for an input size: n. 
i.e  x(n) = x(n-1) + n   for n > 0.   n-k = 0 in this case
i.e x(n) = 3x(n-1) for n > 1   n-k = 1 in this case 
- Make sure to check to see if solving recurrence relations for the basic operations or the values of an algorithm.
- Pick the most expensive basic operation!!!
