- The transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix. (i.e flip the rows and columns and also flip the coordinates)
	- The transpose of any given matrix A can be given as A^T

- A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose matrix (i.e A square matrix that remains unaltered when its transpose is calculated.)
