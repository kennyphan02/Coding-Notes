**Binary Search**

- This algorithm is used on a sorted array of n elements. 
- Divides the search interval in half. 
- Time Complexity: O(Log n)
- Steps to a binary search:
	- Sort the array in ascending order
	- set the low index to first element and high index to last element
	- set middle index to average of low and high index
	- if element at middle index is at target element, return the middle index 
	- If target element is less than the element index, set the high index to middle index-1
	- If target element is greater than the element index, set the low index to middle index+1
	- Repeat steps until element is found
- Time complexity cases
	- Average case: Thetha (Log N)
	- Best case: Î©(1)
	- Worst case: O(Log N)
	- Recurrence Relation for binary search:
		- Basic operation: Key comparison.
		- T(1) = 1  // Base case. compares the middle index to the key 
		- T(n) = T(n/2) + 1  N = 2^k   //Recursively divides the array in half.
