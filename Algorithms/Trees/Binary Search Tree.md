- Node-based binary tree data structure has the following properties:
	- The left child is smaller than the parent
	- The right child is larger than the parent
	- The subtree of each child must also be a binary search tree
	- No duplicate nodes
- How to traverse all the nodes in a binary search tree?
	- In-order traversal (left, root, then right)
	- Pre-order traversal (root, left, right)
	- PostOrder traversal (left, right, root)
