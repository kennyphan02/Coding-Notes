- Why use a tree over linear data structures such as arrays, linkedlists, stack, and queues?
	- Trees are faster when it comes to accessing data as it is non-linear. 
- Terminology
	- Node - Contains a key value and a pointer to its child nodes 
	- Leaf nodes - nodes that do not contain any children
	- Internal node - node having atleast one children
	- Edge - link between any two nodes 
		- In a tree there contains n-1 edges where n is the number of nodes
	- Root - topmost of a tree
	- Height of a node - number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (longest path from root to a leaf node)
	- depth of a node - number of edges from the node to the root
	- height of a tree - height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node 
	- degree of a node - total number of branches of that node
	- Forest - a collection of disjoint trees
