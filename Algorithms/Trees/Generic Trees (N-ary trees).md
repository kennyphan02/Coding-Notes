- Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node contains multiple references to its children
	- Properties:
		- Many children at every node
		- Number of nodes for each node is not known in advance
- First child, next sibling representation of a n-ary tree
	- First child, next sibling is treated as a binary representation 
	- Rather than having pointers pointing to every child, Only one pointer is pointed to the first child in a tree then pointers pointed to the next siblings. 
		- How is this different than a typical N-ary tree?
			- Memory allocation is reduced. With a typical N-ary tree, new node pointers
