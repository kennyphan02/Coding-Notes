- Containers
	- Holder object that stores a collection of other objects (Example: An array holding various int objects)
		- Implemented as class templates 
- Function Templates
	- Pass data type as a parameter so that one would not have to write the same code for different data types
	- Two keywords to support templates: template and 'typename'. second keyword can be replaced by the keyword 'class'
	- After declaring a function template we can call it in other functions/templates with the following syntax:
		- `functionName<dataType>(parameter1, parameter2...)`

- Scope resolution operator ::
	- Used to access global variables when there is a local variable with the same name 
	- Used to define a function outside a class 
	- Used to access a class's static variables
- Class Templates
	- Similar to function templates, you can create a single class to work with different data types
	- After defining a class template, we can create its object in the syntax:
			- `className<dataType> classObject;`
