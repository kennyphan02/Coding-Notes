Can you provide an example of a challenging technical problem you've encountered and how you went about solving it?
- asked backend guy for rundown on uuids
Back when I was learning about nested for loops and UUIDS
One of the test cases for our internship system was being able to log in as the organization and display its internship postings on the console and be able to see the different students that applied for it. 
- UUIDS
- 1st loop to iterate through every job posting for the organization
- 2nd loop to iterate through the student list for each job posting. The student list contains the student uuids
- 3rd loop is to compare the student uuids from the list to a singleton list of student uuids from the database.  
Could have used hashmaps to store the UUIDs

Organization Skills
- Capstone project utilizing the SLDC model. We first planned what our app was gonna be and we brainstormed several ideas and collaborated together to agree on 1. After coming up with an idea, we designed how the screens and features would like using Lucid. Then we went into detail what the requirements for our application would be. In order to implement our requirements we had to do a ton of research in figuring out the technologies we would be using and integrating it into our application (FireStore, FireBase authentication, calendar library, espresso testing). We also had to look up various tutorials on how to implement these functionalities such as the sign-up and login feature and navigating between different screens. After we implemented all of our functionalities for the application, we have started testing our application using espresso with UI and unit tests.
