- asked backend guy for rundown on uuids
Back when I was learning about nested for loops and UUIDS
One of the test cases for our internship system was being able to log in as the organization and display its internship postings on the console and be able to see the different students that applied for it. 
- UUIDS
- 1st loop to iterate through every job posting for the organization
- 2nd loop to iterate through the student list for each job posting. The student list contains the student uuids

Could have used hashmaps to store the UUIDs
