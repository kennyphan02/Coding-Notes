FCFS 
HFCS 
SJF (a.k.a. SJN)
***STCF***


Given that CPU virtualization and Memory Virtualization both require hardware support to do 
efficiently, which of the following is a reason for Memory Virtualization to be more challenging? 

There are more registers for memory virtualization to be saved. 

***The volume of data stored in memory (RAM) is much higher than is part of the non-memory CPU state. (Backing up is impractical) ***

The volume of data stored in registers is much higher than is part of the memory (RAM) state. 

(Backing up registers is impractical) There are no registers for memory virtualization to be saved.


Which of the following are goals of memory virtualization? 
***Giving programs/programmers a simplified view of available memory.
Protecting one program (and the system in general) from a malfunctioning program. 
Efficiency**
Allowing, for certain scen*arios, relocating programs to different regions or just swapping program memory out to disk to free up memory.
