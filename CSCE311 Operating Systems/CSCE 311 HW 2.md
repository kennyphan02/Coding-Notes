**STCF**


Given that CPU virtualization and Memory Virtualization both require hardware support to do 
efficiently, which of the following is a reason for Memory Virtualization to be more challenging? 

There are more registers for memory virtualization to be saved. 

**The volume of data stored in memory (RAM) is much higher than is part of the non-memory CPU state. (Backing up is impractical) **

The volume of data stored in registers is much higher than is part of the memory (RAM) state. 

(Backing up registers is impractical) There are no registers for memory virtualization to be saved.
