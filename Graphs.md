Graph data structure - a collection of vertices and edges (V,E)
	- Collection of edges, E, represented as ordered pair of vertices (U,V)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230217201000.png]]
	- V = {0,1,2,3}
	- E = {(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (0,3)}
	- G = {V,E} 
- Graph Terminology
	- Adjacency - A vertex is adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them (ie: (0,2) is adjacent)
	- Path - A sequence of edges that allow you to go from one vertice to another
	- Directed Graph - A graph with directed arrows. (i.e if the graph above was directed, the edge (0,2) wouldn't mean there is an edge (2,0) as well )
	- Undirected Graph - A graph with edges that do not point in any direction (edges are bidirectional)
	- Connected graph - There exists at least one path from a vertex to another vertex for all vertex
	- Spanning Tree- vertices connected with the minimum possible number of edges. 
	- Connected graph - Every pair of vertices connected by a unique edge 
	- Complete graph - every vertex has an edge to every other vertex 
- How are graphs represented? 
	- Adjacency Matrix: 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertice
		- If the value at `a[i][j]` is 1, it indicate there is an edge (i,j)

	-  Adjacency List: an array of linked lists. The index of an array represents the vertex and each elements in its linked list represents the edges that the vertex form with the other vertices
