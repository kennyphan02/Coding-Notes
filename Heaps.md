**Heap Data Structure**
- ![[Pasted image 20230125122611.png]]
- Operations:
	- Heapify: Process to rearrange elements 
	- Insertion: Inserting an element in existing heap time O(Log N)
	- Deletion: Deleting the top element of the heap (highest priority element), then organizating the heap then it returns the element that was deleted with time complexity O(Log N)
	- Peek: find the most prior element in the heap (max or min element for max and min heap)
- Two types of heap data structures:
	- Max-Heap
		- The root node must be the greatest among all nodes. Every value of a parent node is also greater than its child nodes 
	- Min-Heap
		- The root node must be the smallest among all nodes. Every value of a parent node is also smaller than its child smalls
