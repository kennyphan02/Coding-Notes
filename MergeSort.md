- Divide and Conquer Algorithm
- An array is split up at the middle into two subarrays. (Divide part)
- Sort the subarrays (conquer). If we haven't reached the base case, divide the subarrays and try to sort them. 
	- The base case is when MergeSort repeatedly divides an array into two halves until an array size of 1 is reached. After that, merge is performed and combines sorted arrays into larger arrays until the whole array is merged.
- When the conquer step reaches the base step. We get two sorted subarrays. combine the two arrays to get a sorted array
