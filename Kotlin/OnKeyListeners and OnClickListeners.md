- The code for setting a key listener on a view is a little more complex, but the general idea is that [`OnKeyListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/View.OnKeyListener) has an `onKey()` method that gets triggered when a key press happens. The `onKey()` method takes in 3 input arguments: the view, the code for the key that was pressed, and a key event (which you won't use, so you can call it "`_`"). When the `onKey()` method is called, you should call your `handleKeyEvent()` method and pass along the view and key code arguments. The syntax for writing this out is: `view, keyCode, _ -> handleKeyEvent(view, keyCode)`. This is actually called a lambda expression, but you will learn more about lambdas in a later unit.
