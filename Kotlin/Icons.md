Launcher icon - graphic that represents an application on the device's home screen
- Adaptive Icons
	- Made up of two layers: A foreground and a background layer
- Difference between a vector drawable and a bitmap image (both describe a graphic)
	- Bitmap images only retain color information at each pixel (RGB values) 
	- Vector graphic knows how to draw the shapes that define an image using sets of points, lines, and curves along with color information 
		- Vectors are better as they are more flexible with working with images 
		- Tradeoffs?
			- Bitmap images should be used for complex pictures with a high level of detail
- -   Place app icon files in the `mipmap` resource directories.
-   Provide different versions of an app icon bitmap image in each density bucket (`mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xhdpi`, `xxhdpi`, `xxxhdpi`) for backwards compatibility with older versions of Android.
-   Add resource qualifiers onto resource directories to specify resources that should be used on devices with a certain configuration (e.g. `v26`).
