- Use an IntRange to specify numbers 1-6 on a die
	- Val diceRange = 1..6
	- use the random() function on diceRange to generate a number
- Adding a button textview. 
	- TextView and Button will be located within a *ConstrainedLayout* which is a type of *ViewGroup* 
	- Views within a viewgroup are children of the parent. 
	- In this case, the app is using the textview and button as the children of the constrainedlayout (parent)
- Wrap_content (will be as tall and wide as the content inside it)
- Unit Testing
	- Important for good coding practices (automated unit tests > manual testing)
	- Metadata tags such as @Test is used for writing test cases. metadata tags can change the way code is compiled
