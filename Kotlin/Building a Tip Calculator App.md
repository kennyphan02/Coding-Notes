- XML (eXensible Markup Language)
	- way of describing data using a text-based document.
	- In this app, the XML will be modified
	- Can define the UI layout
	- ![[Pasted image 20230209014459.png]]
- UI for an android app is built as a hierachy of components (widgets) and the on-screen layouts of those components. 
- Each UI element is represented by an XML element in the XML file 
- Adding comments to XML documents Start <!-- and end with -->.

```Kotlin
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"  
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"  
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"  
    android:layout_width="match_parent"  
    android:layout_height="match_parent"  
    tools:context=".MainActivity">  
    
    <EditText  
    android:id="@+id/plain_text_input"  
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"  
    android:layout_width="match_parent"  
    android:inputType="text"  
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"  
    app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"/>
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```
- xmlns: - XML name space - each line defines a vocabulary for attributes related to those words 
- android: - android name space - marks attributes that are defined by the android system 
- All of the attributes in the layout XML begin with one of those namespaces 
- The name of the constraints follows the form `layout_constraint<Source>_to<Target>Of`, where `<Source>` refers to the current view. `<Target>` refers to the edge of the target view that the current view is being constrained to, either the parent container or another view.
-  When you manually type out the XML, you need to explicitly declare the resource ID yourself. New view IDs in your XML file must be defined with the `@+id` prefix, which tells Android Studio to add that ID as a new resource ID.
	- multiple words should be separated with an underscore (_)
- When you refer to resource IDs in your app code, use `R.<type>.<name>`; for example, `R.string.roll`. For `View` IDs, the `<type>` is `id`, for example, `R.id.button`.

-  **ViewBinding** 
	- Makes it much easier to call methods on views rather than accessing the resource id of a view to modify 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230209225326.png]]
	```Kotlin
	// Old way with findViewById()
	val myButton: Button = findViewById(R.id.my_button)
	myButton.text = "A button"
	
	// Better way with view binding
	val myButton: Button = binding.myButton
	myButton.text = "A button"
	
	// Best way with view binding and no extra variable
	binding.myButton.text = "A button"
	/**
	The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to Pascal case and adding the word "Binding" to the end. Similarly, the reference for each view is generated by removing underscores and converting the view name to camel case. For example, in Pascal case activity_main.xml becomes ActivityMainBinding, and you can access @id/text_view as binding.textView.

- EditText - allows user to input text and edit text 
- wrapContent - the height will be as tall as the content inside of it
- Children of the ConstraintLayout must have constraints implemented.
- Can't use `match_parent` on UI elements in a ConstraintLayout


-   XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a way of organizing text, made of tags, elements, and attributes.
-   Use XML to define the layout of an Android app.
-   Use `EditText` to let the user input or edit text.
-   An `EditText` can have a hint to tell the user what is expected in that field.
-   Specify the `android:inputType` attribute to limit what type of text the user can input into an `EditText` field.
-   Make a list of exclusive options with `RadioButtons`, grouped with a `RadioGroup`.
-   A `RadioGroup` can be vertical or horizontal, and you can specify which `RadioButton` should be selected initially.
-   Use a `Switch` to let the user toggle between two options.
-   You can add a label to a `Switch` without using a separate `TextView`.
-   Each child of a `ConstraintLayout` needs to have vertical and horizontal constraints.
-   Use "start" and "end" constraints to handle both Left to Right (LTR) and Right to Left (RTL) languages.
-   Names of the constraint attributes follow the form `layout_constraint<Source>_to<Target>Of`.
-   To make a `View` as wide as the `ConstraintLayout` it's in, constrain the start and end to the start and end of the parent, and set the width to 0dp.
	- 0dp tells android studio not to calculate "X" thing, and just to match the constraints that are on the view. 

- -   **java** folder for Kotlin files (or Java files)
-   `MainActivity` - class where all of the Kotlin code for the tip calculator logic will go
-   **res** folder for app resources
-   `activity_main.xml` - layout file for your Android app
-   `strings.xml` - contains string resources for your Android app
-   **Gradle Scripts** folder
	- Gradle is the automated build system used by Android Studio. Whenever you change code, add a resource, or make other changes to your app, Gradle figures out what has changed and takes the necessary steps to rebuild your app. It also installs your app in the emulator or physical device and controls its execution.
