- List is a collection of items with a specific order
	- Two types:
		- Read-only list: **List** cannot be modified after you create it
		- Mutuable list: **MutableList** can be modified after creating it
	- When using **List** or **MutableList** It must specify the type of elements it contain
		- I.E `List<Int>` holds a list of Integers
		- Use the standard kotlin library function listOf() to declare a list
		- `val numbers: List<Int> = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)` creates a read-only list of numbers 1-6.
			- If the type on the right side of the equal operator can be inferred, we can shorten it by removing the type so it would be `val numbers = listOf(1,2,3,4,5,6)`
- Kotlin has default methods for List 
	- First: returns the first index of a list
	- Last: returns the last index of a list
	- Contains() checks to see if the parameter passed into contains() methods exists in a list 
	- reversed() returns a list in reversed order
	- sorted() returns a list in ascending order
- methods for MutableList 
	- add() method returns true if an item has been successfully added to the list
- When declaring a MutableList use `mutableListOf<Type>()`
	- `val entrees: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf()` or `val entrees = mutableListOf<String>`
		- you can use val for a MutableList because the entrees variable contains a reference to the list and that reference doesn't change even if the contents of the list do.
