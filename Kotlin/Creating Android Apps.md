- User Interface (UI) - composes of text, images, buttons and other elements that a user can see and interact with.
- Each element is called a **View**
- ViewGroup - container that view objects can sit in. 
	- ConstraintLayout - arrange views in a flexible way 
- Views have relationships to each other 
	- The layout can change depending on the size and aspect ratio of the android device that the app is running on and the layout can adapt to whether the device is in portrait/landscape mode. 
- TextView is a View for displaying text
- TextViews needs constraints to position the text 
- One way to position a View is with a margin

- **Activities**
	- Provides the window in which your app draws the UI
	- Apps have multiple activities for different purposes of the App.
- Every Kotlin program must have a main() function. Android apps operate differently. Android systems call the onCreate() method in MainActivity
- setContentView() - creates the app's layout and makes its views available as objects
