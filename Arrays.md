- Array
	- A collection of fixed-size items contiguously allocated 
	- Data is stored in contiguous blocks of memory
		- i.E `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]` where the numbers represent the index of an array
	- Advantanges:
		- Random access - Any element can be accessed by its index in O(1) time 
		- Swapping elements is efficient using a temp
		- Searching through an array is O(n) time
	- Disadvantages:
		- Size is fixed. If data grows beyond the length of the array, a new array must be instianted with a larger size and the contents of the old array need to be reallocated
		- Inserting and deleting elements involve creating a new array and reallocating elements from the old array to a new array in O(n) time
