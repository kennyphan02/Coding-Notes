Hi my name is kenny phan and i'm a senior majoring in computer science. Over the summer i'brushed up on my technical skills learning more about java and object-oriented programmingconcepts and began developing android apps after taking an android app development course last semester using kotlin. I worked with a friend to develop a fitness log app that utilizes a calendar library where users can track fitness-related goals such as what they ate and what lifts theyre are gonna do and logs the information to a calendar. I'm looking for an it internship position and I'm interested in learning more about your company.
