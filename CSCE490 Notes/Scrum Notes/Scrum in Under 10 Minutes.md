	- To start with release planning, we analyze the product backlog and identify the user-stories they want to put into this release backlog
		- Sprints are planned to complete the user-stories within a release backlog to a ship-ready state (meaning features should be completed and tested with no bugs)
		- Sprints are short-duration milestones that allows teams to tackle on in a team project. Generally range from a couple of days to 30 days in length. 
		- Sprints are assigned into a sprint backlog
		- At the end of each sprint, one should have a fully tested product with all the features of that sprint 100% complete.
