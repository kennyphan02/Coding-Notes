# Waterfall Model
The waterfall method is a linear system where each step of the process must be completed before working on to the next one. It follows the system:
Requriments -> Design -> Implementation -> Verification -> Maintenance
The downside with the waterfall model is that it is not flexible due to not being able to go back to one of the processes for revision. The waterfall method is an ideal choice for projects that have a defined outcome and you're running on a budget.
