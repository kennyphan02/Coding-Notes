# Waterfall Model
The waterfall method is a linear system where each step of the process must be completed before working on to the next one. It follows the system:
Requriments -> Design -> Implementation -> Verification -> Maintenance
## Downsides
The downside with the waterfall model is that it is not flexible due to not being able to go back to one of the processes for revision. The waterfall method is an ideal choice for projects that have a defined outcome and you're running on a budget. 
If a requirement is missed, it will cost a lot to go back and fix it

# Spiral Development Model

# Software Prototyping
Horizontal Prototyping - have little functionality depth but broad in features. Example of this is a GUI: 
Vertical Prototyping - deep in functionality but narrow in features. Example of this is integration testing

Rapid Application Development
	- Agile software development approach that focuses on user feedback and applying it to ongoing software projects rather than following a strict plan. Emphasizes rapid prototyping over costly planning
	- Can lead to a suboptimal final design.
