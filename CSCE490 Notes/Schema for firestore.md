This is a bit further down the line when we start coding but I was thinking for each collections that were gonna have for the database we'll create a singleton class that will hold information for 


users 
	user
		id (from firebase auth that holds the username and password)
		display name: "Kenny"

rewards
	reward: 
		id: 001
			name: Crayons
			points: 200
			description: Good for coloring
			avaliable: yes

tasks
	task
		id: 21dkoik
			name: Wash dishes
			description: dishes are dirty. needs to be washed
			points: 300
