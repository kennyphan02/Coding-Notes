This is a bit further down the line when we start coding but I was thinking for each collections that were gonna have for the database we'll create a singleton class that will hold information for 


users 
	user
		id (from firebase auth that holds the username and password)
		display name

rewards
	reward
		id
		name
		cost
		description
		due date
